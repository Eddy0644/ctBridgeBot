In test, sending a TG sticker to Wx takes about 8 seconds.

If a network error is classified as WARN, then maybe a message failed to send.

For a group rename event, its origin is old group, and sender name is new group, with content { changed the group name to "" }

Notes for the future document:
1. run initialisation script to create necessary file
2. put proxy.js inside data/ to use at docker
