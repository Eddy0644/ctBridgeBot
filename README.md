or in-project file [static/CTBR_Docs1_zh.md](static/CTBR_Docs1_zh.md). 

This is a personal training project, as there may be some problems that I didn't notice, so issues and PRs are welcome, if you have any suggestion!

\* The project may contain some function that requires a valid `ctToken` to proceed. You can get a 'trial' token for free (please find link in Q&A group or online document) or [donate here](https://afdian.com/item/b6b1c37a2d5011ee88eb52540025c377) to get a 'donated' token (will unlock more functions if possible).

Thanks for your support.

And, if you have any question that the online document failed to resolve, you can [join the Q&A group](https://t.me/+AHsMZ9yvKK5lMTRl) 
OR browse [this channel](https://t.me/rych0814) and find bot link in channel description to contact me directly.

However, if the question reveals a bug, or you don't want to join groups, please open an issue, I would reply ASAP.
