> Sorry, but this project is discontinued. Although I'm still using it, but I cannot guarantee that your account won't get banned by Tencent if you use any robot program like this one.
And, due to changes in upstream, the project cannot be deployed with Docker anymore, user must setup a Windows VM and install VisualStudio runtime to run it. If you still interested in this program, please go ahead.

> 很抱歉，这个项目已经停止了。虽然我仍然在继续使用它，但我无法保证你的账号在使用像这样的机器人程序的过程中不会被腾讯封禁。
而且，由于上游的变化，该项目无法再使用Docker进行部署，用户必须设置一个Windows虚拟机并安装VisualStudio运行时才能运行它。如果你仍然对这个项目感兴趣，请继续。
